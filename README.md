## Overview

**UnrealX SDK** is an open-source development toolkit that facilitates the creation of blockchain-based games on the Solana network. Designed to lower the barriers for developers, **UnrealX SDK** handles core blockchain functionalities, allowing even developers with minimal blockchain knowledge to easily build, scale, and manage their games.

SDK abstracts the complexities of blockchain operations, providing well-documented tools that simplify the development process:

- **Game State Management**: Save and load game states using an integrated saving system that supports multiple slots and auto-save functionality.
- **Error Handling and Debugging**: Track performance and manage errors efficiently with integrated console logging and debugging utilities.
- **Blockchain Data Integration**: Convert and parse JSON data structures for efficient blockchain storage and retrieval, optimizing the interaction with blockchain data.

**UnrealX SDK** makes game creation not only approachable but also efficient, allowing developers to focus on gameplay while the SDK handles transaction signing, smart contract calls, and secure data storage.
